      <p>
        Hello! I’m Hayden Jenkins, a passionate full-stack web developer with a
        love for building dynamic and responsive web applications. With three
        years of experience in building web apps, I specialize in both front-end
        and back-end development, allowing me to bring a holistic approach to my
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently pursuing my Information Technology degree at the
        University of Massachusetts Lowell, where I am refining my understanding
        of coding and problem-solving. Since then, I’ve honed my skills in
        languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, React, Next.js, and
        PostgreSQL. I thrive on creating seamless user experiences while
        ensuring robust functionality behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in the power of collaboration and am always eager to learn
        from others. Whether it’s working in a team or tackling a solo project,
        I take pride in delivering high-quality code that meets the needs of
        users and clients alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, you can find me playing Call of Duty, throwing the
        baseball, or exploring the latest trends in technology. I’m excited
        about the future of web development and am always looking for new
        challenges that push my boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s connect and bring your ideas to life!</p>
